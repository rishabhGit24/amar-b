# ✅ Files Are Now Saved!

## What Changed

Your generated project files are now automatically saved to a user-accessible location!

## 📁 Where to Find Your Files

```
generated_projects/amar_project_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
```

Example:

```
R:\StartUp\New folder (2)\generated_projects\amar_project_20251208_210530\
```

## 🎯 What You Get

### In the Console

```
✓ BUILDER: Code generation completed
📁 Files saved to: R:\StartUp\New folder (2)\generated_projects\amar_project_20251208_210530
   You can find your generated project at this location!
```

### In the Final Message

```
✓ FINALIZE: Workflow completed

📁 Generated Files Location:
R:\StartUp\New folder (2)\generated_projects\amar_project_20251208_210530

🌐 Deployment URL:
https://amar-app-abc123.vercel.app
```

## 🚀 What You Can Do

### 1. View the Files

Open the folder in your file explorer or code editor.

### 2. Run Locally

```bash
cd generated_projects/amar_project_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
npm install
npm start
```

### 3. Manual Deploy

If automatic deployment fails:

```bash
cd generated_projects/amar_project_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
npm install
npm run build

# Vercel
vercel --prod

# Or Netlify
netlify deploy --prod --dir=build
```

### 4. Customize

Edit the code, add features, modify styles - it's all yours!

### 5. Version Control

```bash
cd generated_projects/amar_project_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

## 📊 Changes Made

### 1. Updated Builder (`backend/agents/builder.py`)

- Changed from temp directory to `generated_projects/`
- Added timestamped folder names
- Added console output showing file location

### 2. Updated Workflow (`backend/workflow/orchestrator.py`)

- Deployer now shows both URL and file location
- Finalize shows file location in final message
- Better user feedback

### 3. Updated .gitignore

- Added `generated_projects/` to ignore list
- Your generated files won't be committed to git

## 🎉 Benefits
