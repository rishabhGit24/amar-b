## Backend API

This application includes a Node.js/Express backend with the following API endpoints:

- **POST /api/contact**: Handles the submission of the contact form. Validates input and sends an email or stores the message.

### Backend Configuration

The backend server runs on port 3001 by default. You can configure this in the `.env` file.

### API Response Format

All API endpoints return JSON responses in the following format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Operation completed successfully",
  "data": {}
}
```

Error responses include:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error description"
}
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 14+ and npm

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` (for backend configuration)

### Running the Application

#### Frontend Only

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Running Frontend and Backend Together

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start both the React frontend (port 3000) and Express backend (port 3001) concurrently.

### Running Backend Only

```bash
npm run start:backend
```

Or with auto-reload during development:

```bash
npm run dev:backend
```

### Testing Backend

```bash
npm run test:backend
```
